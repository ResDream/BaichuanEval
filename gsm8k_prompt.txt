Question: In 2004, there were 60 kids at a cookout. In 2005, half the number of kids came to the cookout as compared to 2004. In 2006, 2/3 as many kids came to the cookout as in 2005. How many kids came to the cookout in 2006?
Let's think step by step
In 2005, 60/2=30 kids came to the cookout.
In 2006, 30/3*2=20 kids came to the cookout.
The answer is 20

Question: Zilla spent 7% of her monthly earnings on rent, half of it on her other monthly expenses, and put the rest in her savings. If she spent $133 on her rent, how much does she deposit into her savings account in a month?
Let's think step by step
Since $133 is equal to 7% of her earnings, then 1% is equal to $133/7 = $19.
The total monthly earning of Zilla is represented by 100%, so $19 x 100 = $1900 is her monthly earnings.
So, $1900/2 = $950 is spent on her other monthly expenses.
The total amount spent on the rent and other monthly expenses is $133 + $950 = $1083.
Hence, she saves $1900 - $1083 = $817 per month.
The answer is 817

Question: If Buzz bought a pizza with 78 slices at a restaurant and then decided to share it with the waiter in the ratio of 5:8, with Buzz's ratio being 5, what's twenty less the number of slices of pizza that the waiter ate?
Let's think step by step
The total ratio representing the slices of pizza that Buzz bought is 5+8=13
If he shared the slices of pizza with the waiter, the waiter received a fraction of 8/13 of the total number of slices, which totals 8/13 * 78 = 48 slices
Twenty less the number of slices of pizza that the waiter ate is 48-20 = 28
The answer is 28

Question: Jame gets a raise to $20 per hour and works 40 hours a week.  His old job was $16 an hour for 25 hours per week.  How much more money does he make per year in his new job than the old job if he works 52 weeks a year?
Let's think step by step
He makes 20*40=$800 per week
He used to make 16*25=$400 per week
So his raise was 800-400=$400 per week
So he makes 400*52=$20,800 per year more
The answer is 20800
